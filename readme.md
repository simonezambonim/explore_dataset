# Data exploring with Streamlit 

This app aims to help data scientists get their first insights of a dataset in a simple and fast way.
Data exploratory analysis is one of the most important steps in a data science project and it can be very time consuming.
However many times this work can be facilitaded using a generalizided code for EDA. By using streamlit and doing it in a simple way, it is possible to 
extract relevant variables from a dataset with hundreds of variables, treat missing values and perform univariate and multivariate analysis.  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The packages needed are in the requirements.txt file.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
